## Notes
I tried starting up my original tap-app angular cli project but was unable to get it started: an error message was telling me that 'ng serve' can only be performed inside an angular cli project. This was after I installed all npm packages, global dependencies, and the angular cli in the home directory.

I need to go back and solidify my understanding of angular project configs.
